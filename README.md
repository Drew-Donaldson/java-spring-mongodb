# Spring Boot with MongoDB

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Spring Boot 3 application developed as part of the Udemy course *"Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6"* by Shabbir Dawoodi, specifically **Section 8: Spring Boot with MongoDB**. The project demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot with MongoDB to build a RESTful application for managing data in a NoSQL database. The application implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, showcasing MongoDB's flexibility for handling unstructured data.

### Key Features
- Configured **Spring Data MongoDB** to connect to a MongoDB database.
- Implemented a REST API for performing CRUD operations on entities (e.g., Person data).
- Used **Spring Data MongoDB repositories** for simplified data access.
- Demonstrated MongoDB document modeling with Java entities.
- Integrated validation and error handling for API interactions.
- Supported querying MongoDB with Spring Data's query methods and MongoTemplate.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: 17
- **Spring Boot**: 3.x
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: For MongoDB integration
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database (tested with a local or cloud MongoDB instance)
- **Maven**: Dependency management
- **Postman**: For testing REST endpoints
- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code (if applicable)
